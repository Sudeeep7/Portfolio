    <h1>Background:</h1>
    <p> I have been actively taking part in several programs as a coordinator as well as a volunteer in trainings and programs under various 
        NGOs & INGOs. Joining NGOs & INGOs have provided me an opportunity to work on various social and humanitarian causes, contributing
         to positive change within local communities and globally.I also take part in curricular activities as well as extra curricular activities 
         in school too.<br></p>
         <h1>Scout:</h1>
           <p> I have been working as a member as well as volunteer of scout since 2020 A.D. By today, I am member of Milan Scout Crew as a active
            rover. Being in the Scout is a transformative experience. It has taught me valuable life skills, from outdoor survival to teamwork and 
            leadership. Camping in the wilderness, earning merit badges, and connecting with fellow Scouts has fostered lasting friendships. It 
            has also instilled a sense of responsibility, self-reliance, and a deep appreciation for nature.
